Title & description of the project: CO2 Emissions by Country

Your name & partner’s name: Grant Nguyen

A description of the data required, and how it will be obtained
(e.g. URL/DOI to data source):
<https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/cait-country> Data will be in csv
format and contain metric tons of CO2 emissions by country from start of
data collection till 2012.

3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit
of the assignments we have been doing:

I will be importing my csv in r and I will use dyplr,ggplot, and more
libraries to create new variables like total CO2 emissions by country
and average CO2 rates by country, which includes use of custom R
functions I will also be creating detailed visual representations of my
findings in the form of bar charts and graphs. Essentially I want to see
which country is emitting most and their rate of emission. I will also
create a website to publish my findings.
